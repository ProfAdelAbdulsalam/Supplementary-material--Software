"MCDM-ML Based Tool for Health Security Optimization in Non-EU Countries: Comprehensive Assessment and Visualization Workflow

This software supplements the research paper titled "Health Security Inequalities in Non-EU European Countries: A Cross-National Comparative Assessment Using an Integrated MCDM-Machine Learning Approach" by offering further details and analyses. It contains the following key elements:

Outlines the research phases
Provides a description of the health security indicators employed, along with decision-making matrices for 2019, 2021, and aggregated 2017–2021.
Entropy Weighting: The results of entropy calculations are presented, which were used to assess the importance of various health security indicators for Non-EU European countries, African, and EMR countries in 2019, 2021, and the combined period of 2017–2021.
Ranking Results: The document provides a detailed account of how the Entropy-CoCoSo model was used to rank the health security performance of Non-EU European countries throughout the study period, including score comparisons and trend analysis.
Cluster Analysis: It explains the use of the K-means model to group Non-EU European countries into performance-based clusters, ranging from high to dangerous, based on their Entropy-CoCoSo health security scores. It also highlights the distribution of these clusters across different regions and three time periods.
Final results.
Overall, this tool provides supplementary material and steps and aims to improve the transparency and replicability of the study's findings, offering a more in-depth understanding of its methodological and empirical underpinnings."
